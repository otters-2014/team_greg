I've tutored since high school, taught ESL in Syria and then New York, where I also taught SAT's. I thought I would go on to become a university professor in Islamic Studies, but I just really don't like writing. Editing other people's work = totally fine, and I'm good at it. Writing original stuff (especially research) = still a question mark.After Dev, I'll be starting a Master's in Applied Positive Psychology at the University of East London. I've made a big part of my life's purpose helping others, and I'm hoping that Dev will enable me to build ... something ... that will make the world a little bit better.Looking forward to meeting you all."}

I'm pretty loose in life, but methodical in my work. So if I start to get too serious, remind me to lighten up. Also worthy of note: I successfully ate the Hot-as-a-Motha from Heaven on Seven and lived to regret it."}
